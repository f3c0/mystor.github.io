    <p>In June of 2015, I had an idea. At the time, I was obsessed with compilers, and
what was possible to do at compile time. For one of the languages which I was
working on, I got excited by the idea that I could have flawless C++ interop by
embedding all of <a href="https://clang.llvm.org">clang</a> inside of the compiler, and
have a special <code>c++ {}</code> form which would allow you to directly write C++ code
inside the program, and give that code access to the stack variables currently
in scope.</p>
<p>That language never came into fruition, but at the time I was also interested in
another language, which I was going to use to implement my
language, <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>. Rust was very interesting to me,
because in 2014 it had been one of the first times I had ever written
"system-level" code. I loved the way it seemed to make everything possible with
apparently no overhead. However, I had run into some problems. I wanted to
use <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a> to implement the compiler back-end for the language
I was working on, but the best LLVM bindings were written in C++, and using them
from Rust was a tedious experience, to say the least. No good LLVM bindings were
available yet for Rust, so I would pretty much have to write them myself.</p>
<p>I, naturally, started wishing that I had the <code>c++ {}</code> block feature in Rust, to
help me write my new programming language. I really enjoy abusing meta
programming features in languages to let me do things which their creators never
intended, so I started concocting ideas as to how I could implement this using
Rust's unstable plugin infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thus, <a href="https://github.com/mystor/rust-cpp">rust-cpp</a> was born.</p>
<p>You can still find the code for this original version of rust-cpp, although
you'll have trouble getting it to build, archived under
the
<a href="https://github.com/mystor/rust-cpp/tree/legacy_macros1.1_v0"><code>legacy_rustc_plugin</code></a> branch.</p>
<p>This initial version of rust-cpp was built with 2 parts, and remains possibly
the most powerful version of rust-cpp to this day. Firstly, it contained a
procedural macro, <code>cpp!</code>, which would perform the Rust codegen, and store
the information parsed in some global state, and then a lint pass, which would
discover the type information for the callsites, and actually generate and compile
the C++ code.</p>
<p>An example use of this API might look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span>: <span class="kt">i32</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span>: <span class="kt">i32</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cpp_result</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">unsafe</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">cpp</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span>-&gt; <span class="kt">i32</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">int32_t</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">c</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">int32_t</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">d</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">c</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">d</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">})</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">};</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>This invocation would "capture" the local variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the <code>cpp!</code>
closure, exposing those variable names to the C++ code. the closure itself then
would return a <code>i32</code>. The C++ code would be contained with a function
invocation, such that the interface looks correct.</p>
<p>The <code>cpp!</code> macro expansion would produce some code which would look something
like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="cp">#[link(name = </span><span class="s">&quot;rust_cpp_tmp&quot;</span><span class="cp">, kind = </span><span class="s">&quot;static&quot;</span><span class="cp">)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">extern</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;C&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">rust_cpp_936DA01F9ABD4d9d80C702AF85C822A8</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">as</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">as</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">as</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">as</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>It would then also record the information parsed from the declaration (the names
of the arguments, the body text extracted from the original span as a string,
etc.) in the global storage.</p>
<p>Then, the lint pass would run. It would walk the typechecked AST, looking at
every function call. If the function call begain with the name <code>rust_cpp_</code>, it
would be considered as a <code>rust-cpp</code> call. The matching function would be looked
up from global storage.</p>
<p>We would then look at the pre-casting types of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and try to guess the
C++ type from them. If we failed, we would default to passing an opaque type to
C++.</p>
<p>Once the lint pass had seen every function call which was generated earlier by
the <code>cpp!</code> procedural macro, it would write out a <code>rust_cpp_tmp.cpp</code> file, which
would then be shelled out to the native c++ compiler. The above function would
have been generated similar to the following:</p>

<p>The code would then use an
<a href="https://github.com/mystor/rust-cpp/blob/legacy_rustc_plugin/src/lint.rs#L206-L221">ugly hack</a> to
insert the compiled static library into the <code>SearchPaths</code> object, causing it to
be linked in when the compiler performs the final link step.</p>
<p>This plugin was pretty cool. It could allow you to embed arbitrary C++ code into
your Rust code, was fairly easy to add, and inferred a lot of types for you to
boot! Unfortunately, it required unstable Rust, which meant that people
definitely couldn't use it, and also meant that I had to push a new version very
frequently to keep up with bustage.</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to rewrite <code>rust-cpp</code>, and shed some of the cool features,
in persuit of it working on stable Rust, but that's a story for part 2.</p>
